# Frontend Environment Variables
# Copy values to .env.local for development or configure in Cloudflare Pages for production

# Backend API URL for tRPC and Better Auth clients
# REQUIRED: This must be set for the application to work properly

# For local development:
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8787

# For production/remote deployment (set in Cloudflare Pages dashboard):
# VITE_API_URL=https://workers.mvpkit.dev

# Note: Better Auth requires direct backend connection for authentication cookies
# The Vite proxy handles tRPC requests, but auth needs direct backend access
